I have created this dashboard as part of my data analyst portfolio, that shows basic statistics of Data Professionals like: 
- Their Country.
- Their Favorite Programming Language.

# Dataset
The dataset originally consists of 630 responses from individuals spread across the world with the greatest portion of them being from the United States(261 Survey Takers), the survey collected information about an individual's profession, education and demographic information among others. 

The dataset was cleaned and processed through the power editor in Power BI. First off, there were some columns in the original dataset with no values so those were removed. Some other fields such as Job Title, Country and Salary were modified to be more suitable for visualization.
