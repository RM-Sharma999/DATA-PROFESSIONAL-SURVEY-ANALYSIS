# Data Professionals Survey Analysis - Power BI

I have created this dashboard as part of my data analyst portfolio, that shows basic statistics of Data Professionals like: 
- Their Country.
- Their Favorite Programming Language.
- Their Average Salary By Job Title.
- Their Average Salary By Gender.
- Happiness With Work/Life Balance.
- Happiness With Salary.

# Dataset
The dataset originally consists of 630 responses from individuals spread across the world with the greatest portion of them being from the United States(261 Survey Takers), the survey collected information about an individual's profession, education and demographic information among others. 

The dataset was cleaned and processed through the power editor in Power BI. First off, there were some columns in the original dataset with no values so those were removed. Some other fields such as Job Title, Country and Salary were modified to be more suitable for visualization.

# Insights
- The Individuals who took the survey were largely from US, UK, India and Canada.
- The favorite programming language across all job titles is Python. R is also a highly chosen option in many of the cases. Both languages happen to be highly capable in data analysis, visualization and machine learning.
- The Survey shows that the highest paying job titles were: Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Architect and Data Analyst.
- The Survey also shows that Average Salary of Females is slightly greater than Males.
- On Average, the individual's Happiness With Work/Life Balance was about 5.74 / 10.
